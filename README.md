# DSA_SOC-2022

# In the week 1, I learned what is Github and started using it. The folder I had added to my master branch for week 1 consists of a git-cheat-sheet which 
I will be using for my future refrence.

# The week 2 made me learnt that how easy coding problems can be made if we start using the bit magic methods. The folder contains the problems related to the same 
which I understood and solved during my journey.

# The week 3 helped me learn the arrays, searching elements in them and sorting them using various methods. The folder consists of the content for the same.

# The week 4 was a little new to me, because I had never learnt that much about Matrix in any coding language. Also, I learnt the concept of the Hashing during that 
week ( which was completely new to me ). The solved and the learnt content by me is added in the respective folder.

# The week 5 was not that hectic. The strings and the concept of Linked list was not new to me and that week helped me learnt that concept in more efficient manner.
The folder contains the content for the same.

# Week 6 was the most intresting week, the concepts were very new and very-very intreseting. I learned a lot about the computer memory usage and other things a lot 
that week. The codes for the same is attached in the respective folder.

# Week 7 was also a new and intresting one. Trees and binary trees was something I heard around 2 months before that week but thought as one of the toughest concept 
I am gonna face in my life. But I enjoyed a lot about the trees in that week. The respective folder contains the same different methods and codes for them.

# Week 8 made me learnt about the concept of heaps and helped me learn a lot of graph which we use in the DSA world. The content for the same is attached in the 
respective folder.

# In week 9, I learnt about the dynamic programming, how the memory is allocated dynamically and also the backtracking algorithm to solve the various problems.
I had also attached the code for the solved problems in the respective folder. 

# Week 10 helped me out learn some new type of algos and some new method of the trees which can be used to sove the problems. The respective folder has the content 
for the same.
