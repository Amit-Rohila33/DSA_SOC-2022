<!-- Backtracking technique definition -->

Backtracking is a technique based on algorithm to solve problem. It uses recursive calling to find the solution by building a solution step by step increasing values with time. It removes the solutions that doesn't give rise to the solution of the problem based on the constraints given to solve the problem.

<!-- Applications -->

Backtracking algorithm is applied to some specific types of problems,

1). Decision problem used to find a feasible solution of the problem.

2). Optimisation problem used to find the best solution that can be applied.

3). Enumeration problem used to find the set of all feasible solutions of the problem.


<!-- Algorithm -->



Step 1 − if current_position is goal, return success
Step 2 − else,
Step 3 − if current_position is an end point, return failed.
Step 4 − else, if current_position is not end point, explore and repeat above steps
